My Data Analytics Portfolio

## A bit about me..

I'm a recent graduate from Delhi Technological University who also happens to have a penchant for data. 

Data excites me a lot. I have always been a "numbers" guy, especially since I am a massive football fan, I dwell in stats and data surrounding football matches all the time. 

My biggest achievement to date is leading a team of nine people in my college's final year Predictive Modeling course project to develop a predictive model for detecting heart disease using Machine Learning. I demonstrated leadership abiities that I didn't know I possessed throughout the development of that project.
